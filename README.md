# NOISE

A simple NodeJS command line utility that grabs data from Spotify for a given artist. 
This is currently being used to develop the beardgel.ca artists page. The utility is pretty
bare bones at the moment, but will gain functionality as time progresses.

# Set up
Set up is easy
1. Set up a .env file in the root directory with the client id and secret variables filled in with one's obtained from Spotify
2. run npm install
3. run npm start 

And that's it!
